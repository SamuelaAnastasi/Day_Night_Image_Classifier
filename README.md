# CVND Day/Night Image Classifier with OpenCV

These notebooks are a series of exercises from Udacity's Computer Vision Nanodegree that aim to build step by step a day/night image classifier using a simple algorithm. The classification is based on the brightness level (V channel) of images converted in the HSV colorspace.  

The dataset used is The AMOS dataset (Archive of Many Outdoor Scenes) divided into labeled train/test sets for training and evaluation. The project shows the limitation of the algorithm used in reaching a high accuracy and provides insights on the reasons behind cases of misclassification and on how to improve the model.
